# ‚úçÔ∏è Air Digit Recognition with Hand Tracking

This project uses **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and a pre-trained **ONNX MNIST model** to allow users to draw digits in the air using their index finger, and then recognizes those digits using a neural network.

## üß† How It Works

- Uses your **webcam** to detect your **hand movements** via **MediaPipe**.
- Tracks your **index finger** to "draw" in the air inside a predefined green box.
- You can press `r` to **recognize the digit** you just drew.
- The digit is processed, centered, resized to 28x28 pixels, and then passed to a pre-trained **MNIST model in ONNX format**.
- Press `q` to quit the program.
